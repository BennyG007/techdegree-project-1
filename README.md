TechDegree Project 1
 Random Quote Generator

 The purpose of this project is to select a random quote from an array of objects and displays that quote on the web page. Everytime the user clicks "show another quote" you will get a random quote. 

 If nothing is selected, the page will auto refresh every 5 seconds with a new quote. 

 The background color of the page also changes everytime you click the button or no action is taken for 5 seconds.
